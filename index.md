## About Me

I am a Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at NIT Rourkela, where I am about to complete my PhD in Theoretical Physics. My research blends string-theoretic holography, nonlinear dynamics, and black-hole thermodynamics to uncover signatures of chaos in strongly coupled systems. I have examined how magnetic fields and chemical potentials affect chaos in holographic QCD and used chaos-based diagnostics to probe phase transitions in AdS black holes. More recently, I developed a charged soliton-based approach to study both classical and quantum chaos in confined QCD, and I am beginning to investigate the subtle role of quantum scars in strongly interacting field theories.

## Research Interests

- **General Relativity:** Black Hole Thermodynamics
- **String Theory:** AdS/CFT Correspondence
- **Chaos:** Holographic and Quantum Chaos
- **Condensed Matter:** Quantum Many Body Scars
