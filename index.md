## About Me

I am a Senior Research Fellow at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, currently pursuing my PhD in Theoretical Physics. I am working in String Theory, focusing mainly on applying the AdS/CFT Correspondence (Holography) to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In my recent work, I studied QCD chaos using a dynamical holographic model. I am also investigating the black hole phase transition in AdS space using Lyapunov exponents, primarily the diagnostic tools for chaos, thereby trying to bridge two areas in Physics: Chaos and Black Hole Thermodynamics.

## Research Interests

- **General Relativity:** Black Hole Thermodynamics
- **String Theory:** AdS/CFT Correspondence
- **Chaos:** Holographic and Quantum Chaos
