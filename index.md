## About Me

I am a Senior Research Fellow at Department of Physics and Astronomy, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha currently pursuing my PhD in Theoretical Physics. I am working in the field of String Theory focusing mainly on the application of the AdS/CFT Correspondence (Holography) to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In my recent work I am studying QCD chaos by making use of a dynamical holographic model. I am also investigating the black hole phase transition in AdS space using Lyapunov exponents which are primarily the diagnostic tools for chaos, thereby trying to bridge two different areas in Physics, Chaos and Black Hole Thermodynamics.

## Research Interests

- **General Relativity:** Black Hole Thermodynamics
- **String Theory:** AdS/CFT Correspondence
- **Chaos:** Holographic and Quantum Chaos
